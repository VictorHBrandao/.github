# Le Wagon GHA worflow templates

## Available templates

- [`clean-metadata`](/workflow-templates/clean-metadata.yml), a metadata cleaner for notebooks
- [`readmes-checker`](/workflow-templates/readmes-checker.yml), a [check](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/checks) for presence of `README.md` file in challenges directories

## Debugging a GHA

[tmate](https://github.com/mxschmitt/action-tmate) provides a GHA step allowing to connect remotely to the container running the GHA in order to explore it

The *tmate* step will run until a SSH remote connection is established and then closed, or once the 360mn GHA execution timeout is reached

In order to use *tmate*:

1. Add the *tmate* step to a GHA

``` yaml
    - name: Setup tmate session
      uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3
```

2. Run the GHA

3. Go to GitHub and open the [Actions tab of the running GHA](https://github.com/lewagon-test/data-solutions/actions)

4. *tmate* provides the instructions to connect to the GHA container when the *tmate* step is running

At this moment *tmate* will wait until a connection is opened

üëÜ Copy the ssh command from the GHA logs

5. Open a terminal and paste the SSH connection command

``` bash

6. Hit **q** to skip the message

``` bash
Tip: if you wish to use tmate only for remote access, run: tmate -F                                               [0/0]
To see the following messages again, run in a tmate session: tmate show-messages
Press <q> or <ctrl-c> to continue

8. Once you are done, exit the SSH connection in order to resume the execution of the remaining GHA steps

``` bash
exit
```
